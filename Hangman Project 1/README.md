#Terry-Kemp-Project-1

The project is a basic classic hangman game made with HTML5, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, and basic JQuery (I learned from reading a few articles to make a few of the items work.) There is no need to download or install any software.  The game works on all devices.

The intention is to show my abilities with the HTML5, CSS, Javascript.  Although, I am very comfortable with HTML and CSS, the Javascript took me out of my comfort zone and had to re-think a lot of my functions and variables.

FEATURES:

I utilized a lot of CS and responsive design to make the graphics and background fall in line. A music player has been add the the footer, that will play music as you play the game.
