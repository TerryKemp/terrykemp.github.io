<h1>Terry's Veteran Transitioning Tips</h1>

<article>
    <h2>#1 Maximize your TRAINING</h2>
    <p>Like me, not everyone (especially E5s and below) leaves the military with a college degree. If you don’t have a degree
        but are close to obtaining it, I encourage you to take the final steps to obtain that diploma. It’s no secret that
        doing so will help you in the short term with your job search and in the long term with your career advancement.
        But not having one isn’t an insurmountable barrier to finding a great career. Military benefits, unavailable to many
        of your civilian competitors, are a great place to start down that path to success. The military offers financial
        assistance to anyone seeking certification(s) in their areas of interest. Draw upon those resources because professional
        certifications can help you distinguish yourself on paper and in job interviews.</p>

    <p>There are hundreds of certifications beyond IT, including Six Sigma, environmental safety, avionics technicians, real
        estate appraisal and assessment, and geotechnical engineering technology. The possibilities are limitless and the
        benefits are generous. Take advantage of them.</p>

    <h2>#2: Don’t Get Lost in Translation</h2>
    <p>Using military jargon to describe your professional experience is a big mistake. Your accomplishments become the equivalent
        of listening to Charlie Brown’s teacher, “Wah wah wah wah wah.” Speak to your audience in language they understand.
        “Gun bunny”, “air bear”, “pop tart”, and “rhino” mean very different things in the world you’re leaving. Translate
        your service experience into business experience, providing your civilian audience with civilian narrative. Leadership,
        managerial excellence, technical accomplishments, and instruction and teaching are important traits to highlight
        in language they can understand.</p>

    <h2>#3: Details Matter</h2>
    <p>We’re all proud of our work and our service to our country; the friendships we forged and the accomplishments we achieved.
        But many vets are reluctant to tout their own accomplishments. Don’t let your insecurity hamstring you in the competition
        for a great job. Drill down deeply into your work. Discuss budgets, cost savings, logistical efficiencies, soldiers
        trained, lives saved, and your achievement of strategic objectives. Don’t be shy about telling employers what you
        did and how well you did it. If you don’t, no one else will. </p>
    <p>The biggest thing you can do in an Interview or when submitting your resume.GIVE THE EMPLOYER A REASON TO WANT TO SPEAK
        WITH YOU AND HEAR MORE ABOUT YOUR ABILITIES AND EXPERIENCE.</p>
